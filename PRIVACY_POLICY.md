## Shlyapa Game: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Shlyapa Game app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Liubov Pitko. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the user is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app:

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :--- | --- |
| `android.permission.VIBRATE` | Required to vibrate the device when the game turn is over |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | This is needed for the online game with friends (currently not working) |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Liubov Pitko.
